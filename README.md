4. Patent Project
Choosing a Project Idea:
Consider areas of interest that align with recent advancements in technology or address unmet needs. Conduct online research or explore patent databases to identify promising topics.
Brainstorm potential inventions and assess their novelty, usefulness, and non-obviousness (inventive step) using patent search tools.
Patent Application Process:

Disclosure Document: Create a detailed description of your invention, including its components, functionality, and advantages. Drawings, diagrams, and flowcharts can be helpful.
Patent Search: Conduct a thorough patent search to ensure your invention is novel and non-obvious. Use patent databases or consult with a patent attorney.
Application Drafting and Filing: Prepare a formal patent application with the following sections:
Title of the invention
Background of the invention (existing solutions and their limitations)
Summary of the invention
Detailed description
Claims (the legal definition of what you're patenting)
Drawings (if applicable)
Patent Prosecution: Work with a patent attorney to navigate the application process, respond to examiner's inquiries (office actions), and potentially argue for patentability.
